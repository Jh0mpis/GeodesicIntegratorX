# Geodesics Integrator tool for Photons in GRMHD using Adaptive Mesh Refinement

The integration of null geodesic equations within the 3+1 formalism of general relativity plays a key role in the process of computing images via ray tracing and analyzing spectra in GRMHD simulations. The objective of this project is to develop a geodesic integrator for photons in a generic GRMHD background using Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), and to accelerate the integration with GPU computing. The implementation will utilize the C++ programming language in conjunction with the `AMReX` framework, which has been built with `CUDA` support enabled. The project will focus both on the accurate numerical integration of null geodesic and on evaluating GPU-accelerated performance. The purpose of this tool is to serve as a post-processing module for the visualization and analysis of GRMHD simulation data. Additionally, it represents a critical first step toward the development of a full Monte Carlo radiation transport code, where fast and efficient geodesic integration is essential.
